##WP AdZonia##
WordPress Ad Management Plugin<br>
Version 1.0<br>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Mayeenul Islam (@mayeenulislam)

A simplest and easiest Ad management Plugin for WordPress sites, and most astonishingly - it's in <strong>WordPress way</strong>. You can call the advertisements into your template using a simple function: <code><?php if ( function_exists( "show_adzonia" )  ) show_adzonia( # ); ?></code>, or you can call the ad in anywhere using the shortcode: <code>[wp-adzonia id="#"]</code>
