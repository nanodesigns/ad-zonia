# How to contribute - AdZonia
You are here because you liked AdZonia and want it to be even better. Yes, you can contribute to make it far better. Here are some ways:

## Bug Fixing and Improvements

### Developer Guide
We're managing things using:

* `npm` ([Installing npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)), and
* `grunt` ([Installing grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started))

Open the command console and type the following to install dependencies:

````
git clone https://github.com/nanodesigns/adzonia.git adzonia && cd adzonia && npm install
````

Then run `grunt` to prepare necessary javascripts and styles.

Now modify where you feel necessary, and create a Pull Request.

## Submit an issue
You can't contribute by either ways, but you still have something in mind, don't let them wash away. Open an issue and inform us right away.

## Translate in your language
Yes, anybody can make the plugin understandable in your language by translating the plugin. Just start [translating AdZonia](https://github.com/nanodesigns/adzonia/wiki/Translating-AdZonia). And after translation don't forget to share the translation with us.

You can use software like [POEdit](https://poedit.net/download) ('cross-platform) or [EasyPO](http://www.eazypo.ca/), and using the plugins' `.pot` file you can easily translate the plugin locally.
